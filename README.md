# RSI Analysis
Calculation of Radiosensitivity Index (RSI) and Genomically-Adjusted Radiotherapy Dose (GARD) with supplementary Differential expression analysis.

Material for MSc project, 'Assessing the Suitability of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy using Precision Genomics'. Notably, scripts for Differential Gene Expression analysis and the calculation and data visualisation of radiosensitivty index (RSI) and genomically-adjusted radiotherapy dosage (GARD) scores for a single-patient dataset, comprising of 10 tumour samples and 3 adjacent normal samples.
